    "# Exercise 4: Circuit Decomposition\n",

    "You may recall from your quantum mechanics course that quantum theory is unitary. Therefore, the evolution of any (closed) system can be described by a unitary. But given an arbitrary unitary, can you actually implement it on your quantum computer?\n",

    "**\"A set of quantum gates is said to be universal if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set.\"** (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/defining-quantum-circuits.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every gate you run on the IBM Quantum Experience is transpiled into single qubit rotations and CNOT (CX) gates. We know that these constitute a universal gate set, which implies that any unitary can be implemented using only these gates. However, in general it is not easy to find a good decomposition for an arbitrary unitary. Your task is to find such a decomposition.\n",

This library gives users access to a rich set of well-studied circuit families, instances of which can be used as benchmarks (quantum volume), as building blocks in building more complex circuits (adders), or as tools to explore quantum computational advantage over classical computation (instantaneous quantum polynomial complexity circuits)."
