    "# Exercise 4: Circuit Decomposition\n",

    "You may recall from your quantum mechanics course that quantum theory is unitary. Therefore, the evolution of any (closed) system can be described by a unitary. But given an arbitrary unitary, can you actually implement it on your quantum computer?\n",

    "**\"A set of quantum gates is said to be universal if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set.\"** (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/defining-quantum-circuits.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every gate you run on the IBM Quantum Experience is transpiled into single qubit rotations and CNOT (CX) gates. We know that these constitute a universal gate set, which implies that any unitary can be implemented using only these gates. However, in general it is not easy to find a good decomposition for an arbitrary unitary. Your task is to find such a decomposition.\n",
